Our journey started with a desire to change the narrative of Africa by changing how people learn about destinations in our beautiful continent.  Through thoughtfully curated travel experiences we enable you, the wanderer, to experience the colourful culture, history and rich landscapes of our beautiful continent through the eyes of locals right from the comfort of your home. Our virtual experiences also help you plan your trips better based on local insights so you can have amazing trips and experiences. Our goal is to give you a truly authentic experience by connecting you with amazing locals who embody deep love and pride for the diversity and beauty of their land.</p>

                    <p className="center-align">Our mission is to help travel lovers get insights and information about destinations in Africa by connecting them to locals because information that is available is insufficient, mostly inaccurate and stereotypical.</p>
                    <p className="center-align">We also aim to empower locals so they too can empower others. This means we work with locals who are passionate not only about travel but also about enriching their own lives, the lives of others and their communities. Therefore when you book an experience with WaderfullySo, you also empower your Wanderful Host</p>
